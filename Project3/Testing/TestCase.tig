/* This is the test case file. Here is the requirement:
    1. The test case file must be a valid Tiger program. No syntax errors allowed.
    2. The table below has two columns. The first column specifies Tiger construct that must be covered, and
       the second column gives the line # of the statement that is used to test the construct. Please fill the second
       column after you have designed all test cases successfully.
